Abstract
In today’s information age, there is no shortage of market data and financial research.
Yet, due to historically entrenched market dynamics, the economics of financial research
production and distribution are dominated by only a few gatekeepers. This prevents
independent analysts from having a voice, while research consumers are forced to accept
whatever coverage is already available. What market participants truly need is context –
providing relevance in addition to scale. Red Pulse intends to employ RPX as a mechanism
to fairly and directly incentivize research producers for their works, while providing research
consumers with a mechanism to guide research coverage and provide fair compensation.
